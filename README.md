# REST API in Amazon API Gateway with Amazon CloudFront Behavior using AWS WAF for API protection

CDK example of:

- Using multiple behaviors in Amazon CloudFront:
  - Default behavior serving assets from Amazon S3 bucket and an additional behavior serving a REST API from Amazon API Gateway in a custom path
- Using AWS WAF for API protection:
  - Using AWS WAF to protect the REST API from malicious requests and blocking requests from the internet allowing only CloudFront to access the API with a custom header
